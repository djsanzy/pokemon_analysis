This is a beginner data analysis on a Pokemon DataSet. I performed some data manipulations and tried to answer some questions.
This DataSet contains information on all 800 Pokemon from all 6 generation of Pokemon containing data about their type and statistics.
I was interested in analyzing this dataset to learn about Pokemon... Oh, i even googled if Pokemon was real *LOL*
In this analysis, i used only Pandas and Jupyter Notebook.

Questions that i answered:
Finding the strongest pokemon? This was measured using the highest number in the Sp_Atk column.
What is the count of pokemon per generation: Gen 1: 166, Gen 2: 106, Gen 3: 160, Gen 4: 121, Gen 5: 165, Gen 6: 82
The highest pokemon count per generation: Gen 1 with the total count of 166
How many types of Pokemon are there: 18 different types
Find the weakest pokemon using the Sp_Atk column
The most widespread type of pokemon: Water
The least widespread of pokemon: Flying

Finally, check out the code, some questions would have been answered there.
